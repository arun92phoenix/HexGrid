Challenge 
To find the centroid of the hexagons to highlight and draw lines between two hexagons
Solution
d3 has a built in solution to find the centroid of the path geometries drawn in SVG

Challenge
To highlight hexagons which a line is passing over
Possible Solution
To use linear interpolation to find multiple points on the line and then highlight each hexagon which it belongs to.
This is a two part solution. One, to find the points using lerp. Second, to find the hexagon which it belongs to.
